# SEIR Model with Mutation and Traveling for International Vaccine allocation
## by Abraham Holleran and Mike Veatch
We set out to make a SEIR model that includes vaccinations and mutations and accounts for traveling between areas. It's a modified version of a cutting-edge SEIR model used to allocate vaccines by Dimitris Bertsimas. Our model uniquely attempts to describe the ebb and flow of the virus on a global scale. This allows for comparisons of different countries with different vaccination and travel rates.\
It is then embedded in an optimization model that considers the decision of how to allocate vaccines to different areas globally.\
